# Devin Beliveau - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Object and array manipulation.
In terms of new skills, we didn't get a lot of emphasis on anything. I would say that I spent the most time this mod learning Redux.

###Mod4 Action Plan

####First Half of Mod4
Be talking to one or two companies about job opportunities.
 
Try to have one mock interview / do one white boarding question a week.
 
Deliver projects that I am proud of and wouldn't be embarrassed to show a future employer.  

#####Strategy To Achieve Goals:
Spend the first hour of the morning reading emails and drafting responses to companies I've reached out to.
 
Send emails in the late morning.
 
Try to have one coffee meeting a week.
 
Set up mock interviews with instructors or my mentor.
 
Front load projects so I can spend more time focusing on TDD/BDD.

#####Professional Development/Network:
Go to all meet ups I find relevant. One every week if there's time. If not, one every two weeks.

Find two to three companies a week to try and get in touch with.

Meet with my mentor once a week to discuss job search and interview prep.

####Second Half of Mod4
Be in a position where I am going on real interviews.

Have one small personal project in addition to Turing projects.

Focus on Node.js and Express

#####Strategy To Achieve Goals:
Set aside time after class to work on a personal side project.

Find relevant tutorials online to watch before classes on those subjects.

#####Professional Network:
Continue to go to meet ups.

Continue to send emails to companies I'm interested in.

Set up a job shadowing experience at a company I'm in good contatct with.
